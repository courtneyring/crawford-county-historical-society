The Crawford County Historical Society and Museum is a non-governmental, 501c3 non-profit corporation, dedicated to “Collecting, Preserving and Interpreting Documents and Artifacts that illustrate the history of Crawford County, Michigan”.

We collect documents and artifacts mostly through donations from the descendants of the early area pioneers. Items range from the Native American cultures through the lumbering industry and early railroads on through the family histories of the first settlers. Most of the items collected require some sort of preservation that may range from simply being placed in a protected showcase to being kept in a climate controlled environment. For instance, early documents and photographs need to be mounted under acid-free matting behind UV filtered glass.
